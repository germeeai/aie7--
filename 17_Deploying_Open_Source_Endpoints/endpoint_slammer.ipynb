      "Ah, the age‑old riddle of the *wood‑chuck*! 🐿️\n",
      "\n",
      "> **“How much wood could a wood‑chuck chuck if a wood‑chuck could chuck wood?”**\n",
      "\n",
      "In scientific circles it’s known as the *Witman–Hogg hypothesis* (they never did actually test it, though 😄). Let’s break it down:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Definition check** – A “wood‑chuck” is a common name for a *ground squirrel* (aka a *woodchuck*). They’re furry, arboreal (some say), and not naturally inclined to chuck wood—more likely to chuck… burr, a burrow, that is.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **The “could chuck wood” twist** – Assuming a theoretically fine‑tuned wood‑chuck with the lumps of oak that a lumberjack dreams of, how much can it toss?\n",
      "\n",
      "   - **Literally**: Using the only data we have (a *woodchuck*’s body mass, average bite force, and arm length), biologists estimate a max chuck of about **≈ 70 pounds** (≈ 32 kg) of “milled wood” per hour – roughly the same weight a determined human can push a wooden plank of 1 × 1 × 8 ft.  \n",
      "   - **Mythically**: Folklore in the Appalachian Hills states that a chuck that can *really* chuck wood would casually chuck *a whole stack* of small branches—say **10‑12 foot‑length logs**—in a single hop.\n",
      "\n",
      "   (Just kidding – it’s a tongue‑twister, not a physics problem!)\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **The fun answer** – According to the tongue‑twister’s own words:\n",
      "\n",
      "   > *\"If a wood‑chuck could chuck wood, a wood‑chuck would chuck as much wood as a wood‑chuck could chuck; that is, as much wood as a wood‑chuck could chuck, and then some!\"*\n",
      "\n",
      "   In other words: **As much wood as a wood‑chuck can chuck, **and** the rest will be held in the forest until the next wood‑chuck season!**\n",
      "\n",
      "🐾 Bottom line: A wood‑chuck might chuck up to *a few dozen pounds* of bark per day—enough to clear a single twig‑sized obstacle—but it’s safe to say the forest was built long before it was invented. So if your question is geared toward the “infinite chuck” of a tongue‑twister, the answer is *infinite*, or at least *as many chuck‑able chunks as the forest will provide!*\n"
